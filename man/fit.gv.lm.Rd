\title{Linear regression of observed pixel values}
\usage{
fit.gv.lm(im, terms = "g ~ b * w", midline = 1024.5, res.only = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{im}{Acquisition array on which regression is to be performed. Must contain black, white and grey images.}

\item{terms}{Text string providing formula to be fitted. Default is "g ~ b * w", predicting grey value based on black and white.}

\item{res.only}{Boolean: return only a matrix of residuals (T) or (F) a list containing the fitted data, residuals and original data, along with the RMSE and adjusted RMSE.}
}
\value{
If res.only == T, returns a matrix of residuals. If F, returns a list containing a data.frame and the RMSE of the fitted model.
}
\description{
Support function: perform linear regression of specified variables
